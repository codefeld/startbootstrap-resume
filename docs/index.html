                            <p>In this paid internship, I built a Python-based interface that analyzes images to detect and classify objects. It was my first opportunity to apply my programming skills to a real project, and I loved every part of it. I learned how to design user interfaces, fix tricky bugs, and break problems down to find the root cause. This experience deepened my passion for computer science and showed me how much I enjoy tackling challenges with code. It made me excited to learn more about how computers work, take on bigger projects, and continue exploring this subject in college and beyond.</p>

                            <p>I was elected by the VBAS Board of Directors to serve as its youth representative, advancing public engagement in astronomy and space science. I lead initiatives that broaden our audience and strengthen the long-term sustainability of the VBAS, which was founded 70 years ago by the rocket scientists responsible for NASA’s Apollo Program.</p>
                            <p>I help inspire more than 5,000 students each year by volunteering at outreach events and planetarium shows where I operate telescopes, share the VBAS meteorite collection, and help educate the public about space science. One Saturday each month, I work as a Planetarium Intern, operating planetarium and AV equipment.</p>
                            <p>I also create educational videos for the VBAS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VonBraunAstroSociety">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vonbraunastrosociety/">Instagram</a> accounts. My videos have received more than 40,000 views and added hundreds of new followers, helping to attract new members, donors, and grant opportunities. This digital outreach played a key role in raising donations for a new $50,000 endowment fund in 2024.</p>

                            <p>As a freshman, I founded a computer programming club at my school to share my love of coding with my classmates. We participate in hackathons and programming competitions, where we have won city-wide and state-wide awards. We meet weekly to teach, learn, and have fun with programming. Competition weekends are some of my favorite high school memories because they showed me that learning is best when shared with friends. We whiteboard ideas, work through problems together, stay up late, and eat a ton of pizza. Our club is as much about camaraderie as code.</p>

As a band member, I attended a 3-day workshop each year and performed in front of an audience. I learned how to play with a large group of highly talented musicians and rehearse new songs with them in a short period of time. I also had the opportunity to perform several improvised solos, which is my favorite part of playing jazz.</p>

                            <p>As a member of my high school varsity bowling team since freshman year, being elected Team Captain my senior year has been one of my proudest experiences. After earning Teammate of the Year as an underclassman, I was excited to take on a leadership role and help create a positive team culture. I focus on inspiring my teammates, especially the underclassmen, by encouraging them during tough matches and celebrating their successes. I also make sure we have fun, for example by wearing a turkey hat when someone gets three strikes in a row. Leading the team has taught me how to support others, build community, and set an example through my actions.</p>
